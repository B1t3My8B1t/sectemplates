# SecTemplates.com - Release #3: Bug Bounty Program Release Pack 1.0

## Bug Bounty Program Release Pack 1.0
I'm pleased to announce our third release, the Bug Bounty Program Pack. The goal of this release is to provide you with everything you need to establish a bug bounty program. This includes working with a vendor, establishing a private bug bounty, and ultimately moving to a public bug bounty. This release pack is not sponsored or influenced by any particular bug bounty vendor and is neutral to vendor biases and influence.
