# SecTemplates.com - Release #2: External Penetration Testing Program Release Pack 1.0

## Introduction
I have built out several penetration testing programs, both internally and externally at companies such as eBay, Paypal, and Box to name a few. Before you have the resources for an internal penetration testing program, you're going to need to work with external vendors to perform your testing. This release pack outlines the process I have used successfully, for more than a decade, for kicking off and managing an external pentest. <br><br>

## External Penetration Testing Program Release Pack 1.0
I'm pleased to announce our second release, the External Penetration Testing Program release pack. This release contains everything you need to scope your first pentest, work with a vendor, execute, and get the types of reports you need from an external tester. This will enable you to perform your first product or infrastructure level penetration test, and provide you with a process moving forward for future engagements.

In this pack, we cover:<br>
<b>Preparation Checklist</b>: This checklist outlines everything you need to scope and perform an external penetration test with a third party.<br>
<b>Penetration Testing Reporting Requirements:</b> This document provides a list of minimal requirements that should be contained within a penetration testing report. Before finalizing a SOW with the vendor, look here first.<br>
<b>Penetration Testing Process Workflow:</b> An outline of a simplified pentesting process with an external tester. It aligns roughly with the content in the penetration testing checklist.<br>
