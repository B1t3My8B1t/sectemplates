# SecTemplates.com - Release  #1: Security incident response release pack 1.0

# Introduction 
I've worked in the security industry for over 20 years and, during this time, have built and shaped many security programs. At every company I join, I find myself recreating or developing security programs from scratch. My peers have been in a similar position, and the more people I speak with at smaller companies, the more obvious it becomes that there isn't a single location where people can download ready-to-go security programs entirely for free. There's a lot of content online, but it can be difficult to find and challenging to know where to start. I created SecTemplates as a side project to provide baseline programs for smaller security teams without direct expertise in building such programs.
