# Sectemplates

I'd like to announce the creation of <a href="https://www.sectemplates.com">SecTemplates.com</a>, a website where infosec professionals, and startup engineering teams lacking a security team, can find templates to help bootstrap their programs. The primary focus of this site will be to provide starting points for

- Preparation checklists
- Runbooks
- Programs and their associated processes
- Useful security metrics
- Document templates
