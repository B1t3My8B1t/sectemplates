# Bug Bounty Sample Responses


## About
The goal of this document is to provide you with copy/paste message and email templates that can be used to communicate with external security researchers. These are simply meant as a starting point, and we recommend you tweak them according to what works best for your company. For responding to a security researcher, we recommend using an alias or shared account instead of an individual employee's account. By responding as an individual, things may get lost or delayed, and researchers may circumvent the intended review process by contacting people directly.
